        Tarantool is an open-source in-memory DBMS combined with a Lua
        application server. In some benchmarks it has proven to be faster than
        any of the better-known NoSQL products, and Mail.Ru is committed to
        making Tarantool the best-known as well as the best. The product is in
        production use within many small and large companies, as well as within
        Mail.Ru itself.

        The features include sharding, replication, write-ahead logging, a
        variety of journal log options, load balancing, Lua stored procedures,
        connectors for C, Perl, PHP and Python, modules for interaction with
        MySQL or PostgreSQL.

        There's a team of developers employed by Mail.Ru which creates and
        distributes Tarantool in the open source community.

          replaces defective parts and distributes the database load to multiple
          machines.
