        | Q: |br| | Why Tarantool? |br|                                                                  |
        | A: |br| | Tarantool is the latest generation of a family of in-memory data servers             |
        |         | developed for web applications. It is the result of practical experience             |
        |         | and trials within Mail.Ru since development began in 2008.                           |

        | Q: |br| | Why Lua? |br|                                                                        |
        | A: |br| | Lua is a lightweight, fast, extensible multi-paradigm language. Lua also happens     |
        |         | to be very easy to embed. Lua coroutines relate very closely to Tarantool fibers,    |
        |         | and Lua architecture works well with Tarantool internals. Lua acts well as a         |
        |         | stored program language for Tarantool, although connecting with other languages      |
        |         | is also easy.                                                                        |

        | Q: |br| | What's the key advantage of Tarantool? |br|                                          |
        | A: |br| | Tarantool provides a rich database feature set (HASH, TREE, RTREE, BITSET indexes,   |
        |         | secondary indexes, composite indexes, transactions, triggers, asynchronous           |
        |         | replication) in a flexible environment of a Lua interpreter. |br|                    |
        |         | These two properties make it possible to be a fast, atomic and reliable in-memory    |
        |         | data server which handles non-trivial application-specific logic. The advantage over |
        |         | traditional SQL servers is in performance: low-overhead, lock-free architecture      |
        |         | means Tarantool can serve an order of magnitude more requests per second, on         |
        |         | comparable hardware. The advantage over NoSQL alternatives is in flexibility: Lua    |
        |         | allows flexible processing of data stored in a compact, denormalized format.         |

        | Q: |br| | What are your development plans? |br|                                                |
        | A: |br| | We continuously improve server performance. On the feature front, automatic          |
        |         | sharding and synchronous replication,                                                |
        |         | and a subset of SQL are the major goals for 2016-2018.                               |
        |         | We have an open roadmap to which we encourage anyone to add feature requests.        |

        | Q: |br| | Who is developing Tarantool? |br|                                                    |
        | A: |br| | There is an engineering team employed by Mail.Ru -- check out our commit             |
        |         | logs on `github.com/tarantool <http://github.com/tarantool/>`_.                      |
        |         | The development is fully open. Most of the                                           |
        |         | connectors' authors, and the maintainers for different distributions,                |
        |         | come from the wider community.                                                       |
        +---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Q: |br| | How serious is Mail.Ru about Tarantool? |br|                                         |
        | A: |br| | Tarantool is an open source project, distributed under a BSD license, so             |
        |         | it does not depend on any one sponsor. However, it is an integral                    |
        |         | part of the Mail.Ru backbone, so it gets a lot of support from Mail.Ru.              |

        | Q: |br| | Are there problems associated with being an in-memory server? |br|                   |
        | A: |br| | The principal storage engine is designed for RAM plus persistent storage.            |
        |         | It is immune to data loss because there is a write-ahead log.                        |
        |         | Its memory-allocation and compression techniques ensure there is no waste.           |
        |         | And if Tarantool runs out of memory, then it will stop accepting updates until       |
        |         | more memory is available, but will continue to handle read and delete                |
        |         | requests without difficulty. However, for databases which are much                   |
        |         | larger than the available RAM space, Tarantool has a second storage engine           |
        |         | which is only limited by the available disk space.                                   |
