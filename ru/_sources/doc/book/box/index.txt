This section describes how Tarantool stores values and what operations with data
it supports.

If you tried out the
:ref:`Starting Tarantool and making your first database <user_guide_getting_started-first_database>`
exercise from the last chapter, then your database looks like this:

    :alt: data_model.png

Here follow the descriptions of basic concepts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A *space* -- 'tester' in the example -- is a container.

When Tarantool is being used to store data, there is always at least one space.
There can be many spaces. Each space has a unique name specified by the user.
Each space has a unique numeric identifier which can be specified by the user
but usually is assigned automatically by Tarantool. Spaces always contain one
tuple set and one or more indexes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuple set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A *tuple set* -- 'tester' in the example -- is a group of tuples.

There is always one tuple set in a space. The identifier of a tuple set is the
same as the space name -- 'tester' in the example.

A tuple fills the same role as a “row” or a “record”, and the components of a
tuple (which we call “fields”) fill the same role as a “row column” or “record
field”, except that: the fields of a tuple can be composite structures, such as
arrays or maps and don't need to have names. That's why there was no need to
pre-define the tuple set when creating the space, and that's why each tuple can
have a different number of elements. Tuples are stored as `MsgPack`_ arrays.

.. _MsgPack: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack

Any given tuple may have any number of fields and the fields may have a variety
of types. The identifier of a field is the field's number, base 1. For example
“1” can be used in some contexts to refer to the first field of a tuple.

When Tarantool returns a tuple value, it surrounds strings with single quotes,
separates fields with commas, and encloses the tuple inside square brackets.
For example: ``[3, 'length', 93]``.

.. _index-box_index:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Index
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An *index* -- 'primary' in the example -- is a group of key values and pointers.

In order for a tuple set to be useful, there must always be at least one index
in a space. There can be many indexes. As with spaces, the user can and should
specify the index name, and let Tarantool come up with a unique numeric identifier
(the "index id"). In our example there is one index and its name is “primary”.

An index may be *multi-part*, that is, the user can declare that an index key
value is taken from two or more fields in the tuple, in any order. An index may
be *unique*, that is, the user can declare that it would be illegal to have the
same key value twice. An index may have *one of four types*: HASH which is
fast and is best for exact-equality searches with unique keys, TREE which allows
partial-key searching and ordered results, BITSET which can be good for searches
that contain '=' and multiple ANDed conditions, and RTREE for spatial coordinates.
The first index is called the “*primary key*” index and it must be unique; all
other indexes are called “secondary” indexes.

An index definition may include identifiers of tuple fields and their expected
types. The allowed types for indexed fields are:

* ``unsigned`` (unsigned integer between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)
* ``integer`` (signed integer between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
* ``number`` (unsigned integer or signed integer or floating-point value)
* ``string`` (string, any sequence of octets)
* ``scalar`` (boolean or number or string)
* ``array`` (a series of numbers for use with :ref:`RTREE indexes <box_index-rtree>`)

Take our example, which has the request:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    tarantool> i = s:create_index('primary', {type = 'hash', parts = {1, 'unsigned'}})

The effect is that, for all tuples in tester, field number 1 must exist and must
contain an unsigned integer.

Space definitions and index definitions are stored permanently in system spaces.
It is possible to add, drop, or alter the definitions at runtime, with some
restrictions. See syntax details for defining spaces and indexes in
:ref:`reference on Tarantool's "box" module <index-box_library>`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarantool can work with numbers, strings, booleans, tables, and userdata.

+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+
| General type | Specific type | What Lua ``type()`` would return | Example           |
+==============+===============+==================================+===================+
|   scalar     |   number      |    "`number`_"                   | 12345             |
+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+
|   scalar     |   string      |    "`string`_"                   | 'A B C'           |
+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+
|   scalar     |   boolean     |    "`boolean`_"                  | true              |
+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+
|   scalar     |   nil         |    "`nil`_"                      | nil               |
+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+
|   compound   |   Lua table   |    "`table`_"                    | table: 0x410f8b10 |

|   compound   |   tuple       |    "`Userdata`_"                 | 12345: {'A B C'}  |
+--------------+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------+

.. _number: http://www.lua.org/pil/2.3.html
.. _string: http://www.lua.org/pil/2.4.html

.. _userdata: http://www.lua.org/pil/28.1.html

In Lua, a *number* is double-precision floating-point, but Tarantool allows both
integer and floating-point values. Tarantool will try to store a number as
floating-point if the value contains a decimal point or is very large (greater
than 100 billion = 1e14), otherwise Tarantool will store it as an integer. To
ensure that even very large numbers will be treated as integers, use the
:ref:`tonumber64 <other-tonumber64>` function, or the ``LL`` (Long Long) suffix,
or the ``ULL`` (Unsigned Long Long) suffix. Here are examples of numbers using
regular notation, exponential notation, the ULL suffix, and the tonumber64
function: ``-55``, ``-2.7e+20``, ``100000000000000ULL``,
``tonumber64('18446744073709551615')``.

For database storage, Tarantool uses MsgPack rules. Storage is variable-length,
so the smallest number requires only one byte but the largest number requires
nine bytes. When a field has an 'unsigned' index, all values must be unsigned integers
between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

A *string* is a variable-length sequence of bytes, usually represented with
alphanumeric characters inside single quotes.

A *boolean* is either ``true`` or ``false``.

A *nil* type has only one possible value, also called *nil*, but often displayed
as *null*. Nils may be compared to values of any types with == (is-equal) or
~= (is-not-equal), but other operations will not work. Nils may not be used in
Lua tables; the workaround is to use :ref:`yaml.NULL <yaml-null>` or
:ref:`json.NULL <json-null>` or :ref:`msgpack.NULL <msgpack-null>`.

A *tuple* is returned in YAML format like ``- [120, 'a', 'b', 'c']``. A few
functions may return tables with multiple tuples. A scalar may be converted to a
tuple with only one field. A Lua table may contain all of a tuple's fields, but
not nil.

Some of the data types may be used in :ref:`indexed fields <details_about_index_field_types>`.

For more tuple examples see :ref:`box.tuple <box_tuple>`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic operations are: the five data-change operations (``insert``, ``update``,
``upsert``, ``delete``, ``replace``), and the data-retrieval operation (``select``).
There are also minor operations like “ping” which can only be used with the
binary protocol. Also, there are :ref:`index iterator <box_index-index_pairs>`
operations, which can only be used with Lua code. (Index iterators are for
traversing indexes one key at a time, taking advantage of features that are
specific to an index type, for example evaluating Boolean expressions when
traversing BITSET indexes, or going in descending order when traversing TREE
indexes.)

Six examples of basic operations:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    -- Add a new tuple to tuple set tester.
    -- The first field, field[1], will be 999 (type is unsigned).
    -- The second field, field[2], will be 'Taranto' (type is string).
    tarantool> box.space.tester:insert{999, 'Taranto'}

    -- Update the tuple, changing field field[2].
    -- The clause "{999}", which has the value to look up in
    -- the index of the tuple's primary-key field, is mandatory
    -- because update() requests must always have a clause that
    -- specifies the primary key, which in this case is field[1].
    -- The clause "{{'=', 2, 'Tarantino'}}" specifies that assignment
    -- will happen to field[2] with the new value.
    tarantool> box.space.tester:update({999}, {{'=', 2, 'Tarantino'}})

    -- Upsert the tuple, changing field field[2] again.
    -- The syntax of upsert is similar to the syntax of update,
    -- but the return value will be different.
    tarantool> box.space.tester:upsert({999}, {{'=', 2, 'Tarantism'}})

    -- Replace the tuple, adding a new field.
    -- This is also possible with the update() request but
    -- the update() request is usually more complicated.
    tarantool> box.space.tester:replace{999, 'Tarantella', 'Tarantula'}

    -- Retrieve the tuple.
    -- The clause "{999}" is still mandatory, although it does not have to
    -- mention the primary key.
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select{999}

    -- Delete the tuple.
    -- Once again the clause to identify the primary-key field is mandatory.
    tarantool> box.space.tester:delete{999}

How does Tarantool do a basic operation? Let's take this example:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    tarantool> box.space.tester:update({3}, {{'=', 2, 'size'}, {'=', 3, 0}})

which, for those who know SQL, is equivalent to a statement like

.. code-block:: SQL

   UPDATE tester SET "field[2]" = 'size', "field[3]" = 0 WHERE "field[[1]" = 3

1. If this is happening on a remote client, then the client parses the statement
   and changes it to a binary-protocol instruction which has already been
   checked, and which the server can understand without needing to parse
   everything again. The client ships a packet to the server.

2. The server's “transaction processor” thread uses the primary-key index on
   field[1] to find the location of the tuple in memory. It determines that the
   tuple can be updated (not much can go wrong when you're merely changing an
   unindexed field value to something shorter).

3. The transaction processor thread sends a message to the write-ahead logging
   (WAL) thread.

At this point, a *yield* takes place. To know the significance of that -- and
it's quite significant -- you have to know a few facts and a few new words.

.. admonition:: FACT 1:
    :class: FACT

    There is only one transaction processor thread. Some people are used to the
    idea that there can be multiple threads operating on the database, with
    (say) thread #1 reading row #x while thread #2 writes row #y. With Tarantool
    no such thing ever happens. Only the transaction processor thread can access
    the database, and there is only one transaction processor thread for each
    instance of the server.

.. admonition:: FACT 2:
    :class: FACT

    The transaction processor thread can handle many *fibers*. A fiber is a set
    of computer instructions that may contain "yield" signals. The transaction
    processor thread will execute all computer instructions until a yield, then
    switch to execute the instructions of a different fiber. Thus (say) the
    thread reads row #x for the sake of fiber #1, then writes row #y for the sake
    of fiber #2.

.. _index-yields_must_happen:
.. admonition:: FACT 3:
    :class: FACT

    Yields must happen, otherwise the transaction processor thread would stick
    permanently on the same fiber. There are :ref:`implicit yields <atomic-the_implicit_yield_rules>`:
    every data-change operation or network-access causes an implicit yield, and
    every statement that goes through the tarantool client causes an implicit
    yield. And there are explicit yields: in a Lua function one can and should
    add “yield” statements to prevent hogging. This is called *cooperative multitasking*.

Since all data-change operations end with an implicit yield and an implicit
commit, and since no data-change operation can change more than one tuple, there
is no need for any locking. Consider, for example, a Lua function that does
three Tarantool operations:

.. code-block:: lua

   s:select{999}             -- this does not yield and does not commit
   s:update({...},{{...}})   -- this yields and commits
   s:select{999}             -- this does not yield and does not commit

The combination “SELECT plus UPDATE” is an atomic transaction: the function
holds a consistent view of the database until the UPDATE ends. For the
combination “UPDATE plus SELECT” the view is not consistent, because after the
UPDATE the transaction processor thread can switch to another fiber, and delete
the tuple that was just updated.

Note re storage engine: vinyl handles yields differently, see
:ref:`differences between memtx and vinyl <vinyl_diff>`.

.. NOTE:: Note re multi-request transactions

    There is a way to delay yields. Read about execution atomicity
    in section :ref:`Transaction control <transaction_control>`.

Since locks don't exist, and disk writes only involve the write-ahead log,
transactions are usually fast. Also the Tarantool server may not be using up all
the threads of a powerful multi-core processor, so advanced users may be able to
start a second Tarantool server on the same processor without ill effects.

Additional examples of requests can be found in the Tarantool regression test suite
(https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/tree/1.7/test/box).
A complete grammar of supported data-manipulation functions will come later in this chapter.

Since not all Tarantool operations can be expressed with the data-manipulation
functions, or with Lua, to gain complete access to data manipulation
functionality one must use a
:ref:`Perl, PHP, Python or other programming language connector <index-box_connectors>`.
The client/server protocol is open and documented. See this
:ref:`annotated BNF <box_protocol-iproto_protocol>`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persistence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarantool maintains a set of write-ahead log (WAL) files. There is a separate
thread -- the WAL writer -- which catches all requests that can change a
database, such as ``box.schema.create`` or ``box.space.insert``. Ordinarily the
WAL writer writes the request, along with administrative fields and flags, to a
WAL file immediately. This ensures data persistence, because, even if an
in-memory database is lost when the power goes off, Tarantool recovers it
automatically when it starts up again, by reading the WAL files and redoing the
requests (this is called the "recovery process").
Users can change the timing of the WAL writer, or turn it off, by setting
:ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>`.

Tarantool also maintains a set of snapshot files. A snapshot file is an on-disk
copy of the entire data set for a given moment. Instead of reading every WAL
file since the databases were created, the recovery process can load the latest
snapshot and then read only the WAL files that were produced after the snapshot
was made. A snapshot can be made even if there is no WAL file. Some snapshots
are automatic, or users can make them at any time with the
:ref:`box.snapshot() <admin-snapshot>` request.

Details about the WAL writer and the recovery process are in the
:ref:`Internals <internals>` section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data manipulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic *data-manipulation* requests are: ``insert``, ``replace``, ``update``,
``upsert``, ``delete``, ``select``. All of them are part of the ``box`` library.
Most of them may return data. Usually both inputs and outputs are Lua tables.

The Lua syntax for data-manipulation functions can vary. Here are examples of
the variations with ``select`` requests; the same rules exist for the other
data-manipulation functions. Every one of the examples does the same thing:
select a tuple set from a space named 'tester' where the primary-key field value
equals 1. For the examples there is an assumption that the numeric id of 'tester'
is 512, which happens to be the case in our sandbox example only.

.. _index-object_reference:

First, there are five *object reference variations*:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    -- #1 module . submodule . name
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select{1}
    -- #2 replace name with a literal in square brackets
    tarantool> box.space['tester']:select{1}
    -- #3 replace name with a numeric id in square brackets
    tarantool> box.space[512]:select{1}
    -- #4 use a variable instead of a literal for the name
    tarantool> variable = 'tester'
    tarantool> box.space[variable]:select{1}
    -- #5 use a variable for the entire object reference
    tarantool> s = box.space.tester
    tarantool> s:select{1}

Later examples in this manual will usually have the ":samp:`box.space.{tester}:`"
form (#1); however, this is a matter of user preference and all the variations
exist in the wild.

Later descriptions in this manual will use the syntax "``space_object:``"
for references to objects which are spaces as in the above examples, and
"``index_object:``" for references to objects which are indexes (for example
:samp:`box.space.{tester}.index.{primary}:`).

Then, there are seven *parameter variations*:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    -- #1
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select{1}
    -- #2
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select({1})
    -- #3
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select(1)
    -- #4
    tarantool> box.space.tester.select(box.space.tester,1)
    -- #5
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select({1},{iterator='EQ'})
    -- #6
    tarantool> variable = 1
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select{variable}
    -- #7
    tarantool> variable = {1}
    tarantool> box.space.tester:select(variable)

The primary-key value is enclosed in braces, and if it was a multi-part primary
key then the value would be multi-part, for example ``...select{1,2,3}``. The
braces can be enclosed inside parentheses — ``...select({...})`` — which are
optional unless it is necessary to pass something besides the primary-key value,
as in example #5. Literal values such as 1 (a scalar value) or {1} (a Lua table
value) may be replaced by variable names, as in examples #6 and #7. Although
there are special cases where braces can be omitted, they are preferable because
they signal "Lua table". Examples and descriptions in this manual have the "{1}"
form; however, this too is a matter of user preference and all the variations
exist in the wild.

All the data-manipulation functions operate on tuple sets but, since primary
keys are unique, the number of tuples in the tuple set is always 0 or 1. The
only exception is ``box.space...select``, which may accept either a primary-key
value or a secondary-key value.

    **Complexity factors that may affect data-manipulation functions**

    .. rst-class:: left-align-column-1
    .. rst-class:: left-align-column-2

    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Index size        | The number of index keys is the same as the number       |
    |                   | of tuples in the data set. For a TREE index, if          |
    |                   | there are more keys then the lookup time will be         |
    |                   | greater, although of course the effect is not            |
    |                   | linear. For a HASH index, if there are more keys         |
    |                   | then there is more RAM use, but the number of            |
    |                   | low-level steps tends to remain constant.                |
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Index type        | Typically a HASH index is faster than a TREE index       |
    |                   | if the number of tuples in the tuple set is greater      |
    |                   | than one.                                                |
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Number of indexes | Ordinarily only one index is accessed to retrieve        |
    | accessed          | one tuple. But to update the tuple, there must be N      |
    |                   | accesses if the tuple set has N different indexes.       |
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Number of tuples  | A few requests, for example select, can retrieve         |
    | accessed          | multiple tuples. This factor is usually less             |
    |                   | important than the others.                               |
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
    | WAL settings      | The important setting for the write-ahead log is         |
    |                   | :ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>`. |
    |                   | If the setting causes no writing or                      |
    |                   | delayed writing, this factor is unimportant. If the      |
    |                   | setting causes every data-change request to wait         |
    |                   | for writing to finish on a slow device, this factor      |
    |                   | is more important than all the others.                   |
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

In the discussion of each data-manipulation function, there will be a note about
which complexity factors might affect the function's resource usage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Index operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index operations are automatic: if a data-manipulation request changes a tuple,
then it also changes the index keys defined for the tuple. Therefore the user
only needs to know how and why to define.

The simple index-creation operation which has been illustrated before is

.. cssclass:: highlight
.. parsed-literal::

    :samp:`box.space.{space-name}:create_index('{index-name}')`

By default, this creates a unique "tree" index on the first field of all tuples
(often called "Field#1"), which is assumed to be numeric.

These variations exist:

1. An indexed field may be a string rather than a number.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}:create_index('{*{index-name}*}', {parts = {1, 'string'}})`

   For an ordinary index, the most common data types are 'unsigned' = any
   non-negative integer, or 'string' = any series of bytes. Numbers are
   ordered according to their point on the number line -- so 2345 is greater
   than 500 -- while strings are ordered according to the encoding of the first
   byte then the encoding of the second byte then the encoding of the third byte
   and so on -- so '2345' is less than '500'.

   For details about other index types see :ref:`create_index <box_space-create_index>`.

2. There may be more than one field.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}:create_index('{*{index-name}*}', {
           parts = {3, 'unsigned', 2, 'string'}
       })`

   For an ordinary index, the maximum number of parts is 255. The specification
   of each part consists of a field number and a type.

3. The index does not have to be unique.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       box.space.*space-name*:create_index('*index-name*', { unique = false })

   The first index of a tuple set must be unique, but other indexes ("secondary"
   indexes) may be non-unique.

4. The index does not have to be a tree.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       box.space.*space-name*:create_index('*index-name*', { type = 'hash' })

   The two ordinary index types are 'tree' which is the default, and 'hash'
   which must be unique and which may be faster. The third type is
   'bitset' which is not unique and which works best for combinations of binary
   values. The fourth type is 'rtree' which is not unique and which works with arrays,
   instead of 'string' or 'unsigned' values.

The existence of indexes does not affect the syntax of data-change requests, but
does cause select requests to have more variety.

The simple select request which has been illustrated before is:

.. cssclass:: highlight
.. parsed-literal::

    :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}:select({*{value}*})`

By default, this looks for a single tuple
via the first index. Since the first index is always unique,
the maximum number of returned tuples will be: one.

These variations exist:

1. The search can use comparisons other than equality.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}:select(value, {iterator = 'GT'})`

   The comparison operators are LT, LE, EQ, REQ, GE, GT for "less than", "less
   than or equal", "equal", "reversed equal", "greater than or equal", "greater
   than" respectively.
   Comparisons make sense if and only if the index type is 'tree'.

   This type of search may return more than one tuple; if so, the tuples will be
   in descending order by key when the comparison operator is LT or LE or REQ,
   otherwise in ascending order.

2. The search can use a secondary index.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}.index.{*{index-name}*}:select(value)`

   For a primary-key search, it is optional to specify an index name. For a
   secondary-key search, it is mandatory.

3. The search may be for some or all key parts.

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

        -- Suppose an index has two parts
        :samp:`tarantool> box.space.{space-name}.index.{index-name}.parts`
        ---
        - - type: unsigned
            fieldno: 1
          - type: string
            fieldno: 2
        ...
        -- Suppose the space has three tuples
        :samp:`box.space.{space-name}:select()`
        ---
        - - [1, 'A']
          - [1, 'B']
          - [2, '']
        ...

   The search can be for all fields, using a table for the value:

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :extsamp:`box.space.{*{space-name}*}:select({1, 'A'})`

   or the search can be for one field, using a table or a scalar:

   .. cssclass:: highlight
   .. parsed-literal::

       :samp:`box.space.{space-name}:select(1)`

   in the second case, the result will be two tuples: ``{1, 'A'}`` and ``{1, 'B'}``.
   It's even possible to specify zero fields, causing all three tuples to be
   returned.

**Examples:**

* BITSET example:

  .. code-block:: tarantoolsession

      tarantool> box.schema.space.create('bitset_example')
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:create_index('primary')
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:create_index('bitset',{unique=false,type='BITSET', parts={2,'unsigned'}})
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:insert{1,1}
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:insert{2,4}
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:insert{3,7}
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example:insert{4,3}
      tarantool> box.space.bitset_example.index.bitset:select(2, {iterator='BITS_ANY_SET'})

  The result will be:

  .. code-block:: tarantoolsession

      ---
      - - [3, 7]
        - [4, 3]
      ...

  because (7 AND 2) is not equal to 0, and (3 AND 2) is not equal to 0.

  Searches on BITSET indexes can be for BITS_ANY_SET, BITS_ALL_SET,
  BITS_ALL_NOT_SET, EQ, or ALL.

* RTREE example:

  .. code-block:: tarantoolsession

      tarantool> box.schema.space.create('rtree_example')
      tarantool> box.space.rtree_example:create_index('primary')
      tarantool> box.space.rtree_example:create_index('rtree',{unique=false,type='RTREE', parts={2,'ARRAY'}})
      tarantool> box.space.rtree_example:insert{1, {3, 5, 9, 10}}
      tarantool> box.space.rtree_example:insert{2, {10, 11}}
      tarantool> box.space.rtree_example.index.rtree:select({4, 7, 5, 9}, {iterator = 'GT'})

  The result will be:

  .. code-block:: tarantoolsession

      ---
      - - [1, [3, 5, 9, 10]]
      ...

  because a rectangle whose corners are at coordinates 4,7,5,9 is entirely within
  a rectangle whose corners are at coordinates 3,5,9,10.

  Searches on RTREE indexes can be for GT, GE, LT, LE, OVERLAPS, or NEIGHBOR.
