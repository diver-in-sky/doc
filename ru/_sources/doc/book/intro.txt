Preface
===============================================================================

Welcome to Tarantool! This is the User's Guide. We recommend reading it first,
and consulting :ref:`Reference <reference>` materials for more detail afterwards,
if needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to read the documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, you can either *download the whole Tarantool package*
as described in the first part of 
:ref:`Chapter 2 "Getting Started" <user_guide_getting_started>`,
or you can skip the download and *connect to the online Tarantool server*
running on the web at http://try.tarantool.org.
Either way, as the first tryout, you can follow the introductory example
"Starting Tarantool and making your first database"
from :ref:`the second part of Chapter 2 <user_guide_getting_started-first_database>`.
If you want more hands-on experience,
proceed to the :ref:`"Tutorials" <tutorials>` part after you are through
with Chapter 2.

:ref:`Chapter 3 "Database" <database-chapter>` is about using Tarantool
as a NoSQL DBMS, whereas :ref:`Chapter 4 "Application server" <app_server>`
is about using Tarantool as an application server.

:ref:`Chapter 5 "Server administration" <server_admin>` is primarily for
administrators.

:ref:`Chapter 6 "Connectors" <index-box_connectors>` is strictly for users who
are connecting from a different language such as C or Perl or Python â€” other
users will find no immediate need for this chapter.

:ref:`Chapter 7 "FAQ" <faq>` gives answers to some frequently asked questions
about Tarantool.

For experienced users, there are also :ref:`Reference <reference>` materials,
a :ref:`Contributor's Guide <contrib_guide>` and an extensive set of comments
in the source code.
